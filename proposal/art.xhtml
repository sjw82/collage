            <h3>General Themes</h3>
            <p>All of the following artistic movements reject tradition and operate on their own
                terms, as nebulously defined as they may be. My intention is to create a multi
                paneled collage with different panels drawing on different time periods of art
                history. Each of the following movements build on the preceding creating a mosaic of
                reactionary artistic commentary. I primarily work in the neo-dadaist style, so it
                will be a challenge to research and create in several new genres.</p>
            <h3>Dadaism</h3>

           </div>
            <p>Time Period: 1916-1924</p>
            <p>Key Words: absurdist, irrational, anti-art, found-object</p>
            <p>Catalyzed by World War I and spurned by the work of Freud, Einstein, and Marx,
                Dadaism started in Europe and lasted about a decade. In reaction to the atrocities
                of war, the Dada movement embodied absurdist philosophy—the idea that human life is
                meaningless and chaotic, but not pointless. The primary focus of Dadaism was to
                challenge conventions and upend the system of art. It was the first movement that
                was not centered on creating aesthetically pleasing images but instead was
                “anti-art” in that it rejected traditional ideas of beauty and originality. Much
                Dadaist art was found-object rather than originally produced. It was in this period
                that collage became popular as imagery and language was recycled. The movement was
                decidedly anti-war and often satirized war propaganda and journalism by creating
                new, often contradictory, meanings using their words in collages. </p>
            <h3>Surrealism</h3>

                <img src="images/surrealism/surrealism_3.jpg" alt="The Human Condition by René Magritte" height="350"/>
            </div>
            <p>Time Period: 1920s-1930s </p>
            <p>Key Words: psychoanalysis, imagination, surreality </p>
            <p>Surrealism, under the influence of Freudian psychology, focused on unlocking the
                imagination through the unconscious mind; as a result the art often looks dreamy and
                outlandish. While it does not focus on irrationality like the Dada movement,
                Surrealism does react against reason. Rationalism was overtaking Europe in this time
                period and Surrealists wanted to reinvigorate creativity and imagination to create
                “an absolute reality, a surreality.” (Breton, The Surrealist Manifesto) Because the
                art is closely tied to the unconscious of the artist, it is difficult to generalism
                the imagery or style conventions.. </p>
            <h3>Avant Garde and Modernism</h3>

            </div>
            <p>Time Period: 1850s-1950s</p>
            <p>Key Words: innovation, experimentation</p>
            <p>Modernism and by extension Avant Garde was defined by its push for experimentation.
                New techniques and content drove these movements for over 150 years. Modernism
                reacted against Victorian morality and industrialization. Avant Garde, a later phase
                of the movement, includes Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Cubism, Futurism,
                Expressionism, Constructivism, de Stijl, and Abstract Expressionism. A greater focus
                was placed on what was inherent to the form: color, line, form, etc. </p>
            <h3>Postmodernism</h3>
            <div class="photos">
                <img src="images/postmodernism/postmodernism_1.jpg" alt="Holly Jewel" height="350"/>
                <img src="images/postmodernism/postmodernism_2.jpg" alt="The Blond Bombshell 9 by Alfredo Garcia" height="350"/>
            </div>
            <p>Time Period: 1950s-Present</p>
            <p> Key Words: low and high culture, inauthenticity, spectacle</p>
            <p>Postmoderism is most often defined in contrast to Modernism. Where modernism is
                positivist, riddled with metanarratives, and celebrates Western society,
                Postmodernism turns a critical eye on Western society and returns to Dadaist
                ridicule of power structures. The movement is characterized by irony, fragmentation,
                the blurring of high and low culture, subverting the concepts of authenticity and
                originality, and an emphasis on image and spectacle. Postmodernism rejects
                totalizing narratives and absolute truths, favoring the experience of the individual
                and the minority. It embraces the subjectivity of the viewer to change not just the
                meaning but the existence of the art itself. </p>
            <h3>Feminism in Art</h3>
            <div class="photos">
                <img src="images/feminism/Hannah%20Hoch/hannah_1.jpeg" alt="Hannah Hoch" height="350"/>
                <img src="images/feminism/Barbara%20Kruger/barb_2.jpg" alt="Barbara Kruger" height="350"/>
                <img src="images/feminism/Hannah%20Hoch/img.jpeg" alt="Hannah Hoch" height="350"/>
            </div>
            <p>In each of these movements, women have had to fight for their place in the gallery
                and in history. I will be doing additional research on major feminist figures across
                the several movements, but two figures who already stand out are Hannah Hoch and
                Barbara Kruger. Hoch’s focus was on dismantling the idea of the “new woman” in the
                early twentieth century by tearing apart and reassembling advertising and popular
                imagery of women; this practice was anti-capitalist, anarchist, and feminist in its
                rejection of what women were being sold as feminine. Kruger similarly focused on
                advertising and the sale of womanhood through the destruction and collage of
                marketing materials. My focus would be on the shifting of gender roles, with special
                focus on LGBTQ topics, and the barriers for non-male, non-heterosexual people as
                enforced and subverted by technology. </p>
