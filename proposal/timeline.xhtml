            <h3>Context:</h3>
            <p>I’m anticipating ten data clusters and thirty collages: one collage per style per
                cluster. In weeks 4-13 I’m predicting ten hours per collage, though it could take
                more or less depending on style; the physical collage and it’s digitized counterpart
                will be made semi-simultaneously. Early in the summer I’m anticipating three to four
                hours per week spent on the website and four to six hours spent on research and
                later in the summer seven to ten hours spent on the website or related skills. The
                image library will be amassed throughout the summer.</p>
