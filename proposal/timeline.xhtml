            <h3>Context:</h3>
            <p>I’m anticipating three data clusters and three to six collages. In weeks I’m
                predicting ten hours per collage, though it could take more or less depending on
                style; the physical collage and it’s digitized counterpart will be made
                semi-simultaneously. Early in the semester I’m anticipating three to four hours per
                week spent on the website and four to six hours spent on research and later in the
                semester seven to ten hours spent on the website or related skills. The image library
                will be amassed throughout the semester.</p>
            <br />
            <h3>Timeline</h3>
            <b>January</b>
            <p>Week 1-2: Order materials, begin Python, download text documents from database,
                create data clusters, create image library system, initial tests on data cluster
                1</p>
            <p>Week 3: work on Python, search for images: trimming and scanning or trimming and
                printing, wireframe site, read up on styles</p>
            <p>Week 4: build site frame, data mine cluster 1, plan collage progression, continue to
                focus on building image library and researching styles</p>
