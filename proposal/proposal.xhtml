            <p>I propose a project bridging three arenas—data mining, collage, and web
                development—with each process building upon the preceding; creating data,
                visualizing it, then making it interactive. The purpose of the project is to create
                a commentary on the nature of contemporary data management and processing with a
                focus on gender and sexuality in relation to technology. </p>
            <p>A computer is able to identify patterns by reading massive amounts of text—a process
                known as data mining. Viewed as “distant reading” because of the scale, it is able
                to see patterns that a human simply could not if they were to read as many
                documents, though it is not dissimilar to how humans read and compare texts. For my
                project I will be using the MALLET software which focuses on linguistic patterns
                with which I have some experience. For this project I will also undertake learning
                the computer language Python in order to conduct topic modelling which focuses on
                underlying semantic relationships. These two tools would reveal patterns in the data
                from both a statistical and literary point of view. Data will be drawn from the
                Genderwatch database which permits access for up to 10,000 documents. This database
                covers a myriad of topics of which I would choose several key subtopics, after conducting initial tests to determine which categories will be the most fruitful. The sources would be sorted by primary,
                secondary, and tertiary authorship so as to allow for a comparative analysis of the
                language used for different genres and audiences. </p>
            <p>Having prepared the documents, learned Python, and conducted the analyses, I would
                move onto the visual aspect of the project. Collage offers a unique representation
                of mass data. Collage is inherently postmodern for its rejection of metanarratives,
                fragmentation, and questioning of originality. By challenging traditional ideals of
                beauty and power, as per the philosophy of female and queer liberation and by using
                recycled and appropriated imagery, much the same as data is distilled from
                elsewhere, often by spurious means, collage embodies the goals of this project.
                Using the results of the two forms of data mining, I will produce a collage,
                possibly mixed media depending on the characteristics of the identified patterns,
                though primarily photo on canvas. There would be three to six separate collage panels that,
                when put together, create one unified collage, though at least part of one panel
                will be solely digital for two reasons: to leave a hole in any gallery display in
                acknowledgment of the gaps in women’s and queer history and to suggest the
                traversing power of technology, the way it can create something from nothing. I
                would like to cocnentrate on three art styles—Dada, Surreal, and Postmodern—using
                the Artstor database and resources from the Frick Fine Arts library to better found
                my understanding. Spurned by technological advancements, inspired by irrationality
                and innovation, and largely anticapitalist, these movements mirror the positions my
                project is meant to take. In these styles, I would particularly focus on the work of
                female artists, many of whom used their work to challenge gender expectations and
                patriarchal limitations. </p>
            <p>The project continues by adding an interactive element: a website that the user can
                play with that would depict the collages in full and link to snippets from the
                archive. In this phase, I will learn another coding language called Javascript in
                order to enable users to cause changes on the site; without Javascript the site
                would remain static. The collage would be viewable in its entirety on a website and
                every image, when clicked, would be accompanied by an explanation of why it was
                included as well as some information about and from a source in the archive. The aim
                is that the piece could be displayed in a gallery behind an ipad that would allow
                the audience to come into contact with the art and view the digital segments.
                Alternatively, anyone with a smart phone could scan the QR code embedded in the art
                and be taken to the interactive site. The intended viewer would be someone
                interested in gender and sexuality studies or in the artistic movements—in an ideal
                world this would involve school-age individuals—who could walk away having learned
                something about the history and current state of gender and sexuality research. </p>
