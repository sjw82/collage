            <p>I propose a project bridging three arenas: data mining, collage, and web development.
                Each process builds upon the preceding; creating data, visualizing it, then making
                it interactive. The purpose of the project is to create an absurdist commentary on
                the postmodern nature of contemporary data management and processing with a visual
                focus on gender and sexuality. I’m pulling inspiration from the feminist dadaists
                Hannah Hoch and Barbara Kruger and their work dismantling both art and gender
                restrictions. This project begins with a database: GenderWatch. This database covers
                gender roles for both men and women, LGBTQ studies, family studies, and women’s
                studies with tens of thousands of documents. I would cluster articles into subtopics
                by key words and conduct all three steps of the project on each cluster separately. </p>
            <p>A computer is able to identify patterns by reading massive amounts of text—a process
                known as data mining. Viewed as “distant reading” because of the scale, it is able
                to see patterns that a human simply couldn’t if they were to read as many documents,
                though it is not dissimilar to how humans read and compare texts. For my project I
                will be using the MALLET software which focuses on linguistic patterns with which I
                have some experience. For this project I will also undertake learning the computer
                language python in order to also conduct topic modelling which focuses on underlying
                semantic relationships. These two tools would reveal patterns in the database from
                both a statistical and literary point of view. </p>
            <p>Having prepared the documents, learned Python, and conducted the analyses, I would
                move onto the visual aspect of the project: collage. Collage offers a neo dadaist
                approach, I argue the most germane approach, to the representation of mass data.
                Large collections of data are in my eyes absurdist, especially in that they hold
                immense power over the individual and yet are poorly understood by the layman. Neo
                dadaism is the 21st century resurgence of the dada “anti-art” movement that came
                about after World War I, now spurned by phenomena such as the foreboding of climate
                change and the ennui of the iphone generation. This project will retain several
                anti-art principles such as using recycled and found imagery; rejecting traditional
                ideals of beauty and rationality; and purporting anti-war, anti-bourgeois sentiment,
                leaning towards anarchism though rather than being focused on the military complex,
                I would focus on reclaiming the power of technology. This project seeks to make a
                claim about the meaning of technology and data management by observing it through a
                neo dadaist lense. I also anticipate finding similar themes within the database,
                particularly the rejection of traditional beauty and an anarchist slant. Using the
                results of the two forms of data mining, I will produce a collage, possibly mixed
                media depending on what patterns are identified, though primarily photo on canvas.
                There would be a number of separate collage panels that, when put together, create
                one unified collage though at least one panel will be solely digital. </p>
            <p>The project goes one step further by adding an interactive element. The collage will
                be uploaded to a website, viewable in its entirety and every image, when clicked,
                would be accompanied by an explanation of why it was included. By doing this, the
                art escapes both time and place becoming dually postmodern in both technique and
                execution. </p>
