            <p>I propose a project bridging three arenas—data mining, collage, and web
                development—with each process building upon the preceding; creating data,
                visualizing it, then making it interactive. The purpose of the project is to create
                a commentary on the nature of contemporary data management and processing with a
                focus on gender and sexuality in relation to technology. </p>
            <p>A computer is able to identify patterns by reading massive amounts of text—a process
                known as data mining. Viewed as “distant reading” because of the scale, it is able
                to see patterns that a human simply could not if they were to read as many
                documents, though it is not dissimilar to how humans read and compare texts. For my
                project I will be using the MALLET software which focuses on linguistic patterns
                with which I have some experience. For this project I will also undertake learning
                the computer language Python in order to conduct topic modelling which focuses on
                underlying semantic relationships. These two tools would reveal patterns in the data
                from both a statistical and literary point of view. Data will be drawn from the
                Hathitrust database which permits access for up to 10,000 documents. This database
                covers a myriad of topics of which I would choose to focus on LGBTQ studies, family
                studies, and women’s studies. The sources would be sorted by primary, secondary, and
                tertiary authorship so as to allow for a comparative analysis of the language used
                for different genres and audiences. I would cluster articles into subtopics by key
                words and conduct all three steps of the project on each cluster separately. </p>
            <p>Having prepared the documents, learned Python, and conducted the analyses, I would
                move onto the visual aspect of the project. Collage offers a unique representation
                of mass data. Collage is inherently postmodern for its rejection of metanarratives,
                fragmentation, and questioning of originality. By challenging traditional ideals of
                beauty and power, as per the philosophy of female and queer liberation and by using
                recycled and appropriated imagery, much the same as data is distilled from
                elsewhere, often by spurious means, collage embodies the goals of this project.
                Using the results of the two forms of data mining, I will produce a collage,
                possibly mixed media depending on the characteristics of the identified patterns,
                though primarily photo on canvas. There would be between twenty and thirty separate
                collage panels that, when put together, create one unified collage, though at least
                one panel will be solely digital for two reasons: to leave a hole in any gallery
                display in acknowledgment of the gaps in women’s and queer history and to suggest
                the traversing power of technology, the way it can create something from nothing.
                Small panels will allow for all three steps to be continued concurrently throughout
                the summer, the coverage of more topics, and offer more room for me to explore
                different techniques. In order to challenge myself as an artist, I would like to
                further research three art styles—Dada, Surreal, and Postmodern—using the Artstor
                database and resources from the Frick Fine Arts library. Spurned by technological
                advancements, inspired by irrationality and innovation, and largely anticapitalist,
                these movements mirror the positions my project is meant to take. In these styles, I
                would particularly focus on the work of female artists, many of whom used their work
                to challenge gender expectations and patriarchal limitations. </p>
            <p>The project continues by adding an interactive element. In this phase, I will learn
                another coding language called Javascript in order to enable users to cause changes
                on the site; without Javascript the site would remain static. The collage would be
                viewable in its entirety on a website and every image, when clicked, would be
                accompanied by an explanation of why it was included. The aim is that the piece
                could be displayed in a gallery behind an ipad that would allow the audience to come
                into contact with the art and view the digital segments. The intended viewer would
                be someone interested in gender and sexuality studies or in the artistic
                movements—in an ideal world this would involve school age individuals—who could walk
                away having learned something about the history and current state of gender and
                sexuality research and writing, text modelling, and various art styles. </p>
