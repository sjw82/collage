            <p><img src="images/tech_1.jpg" alt="Iphone but with organs" height="250"/>
                I will be conducting data mining, i.e. using a computer to identify patterns and
                relationships within data sets, on the GenderWatch database which focuses on men’s
                and women’s gender roles but also includes LGBTQ+ studies, family studies, and
                women’s studies. I will cluster documents into subtopics and mine and collage them
                separately; for example I may have an Avant Garde men’s gender roles panel, a
                Dadaist motherhood panel, and a Postmodern transgender rights panel. </p>
            <h3>Web Development and Interactivity </h3>
            <p>All of the art styles that I am encompassing in this project feature an element of
                subjectivity; the viewer alters the artwork. To keep with that motif, the collage
                will be available online in a clickable format that allows the viewer to interact
                with the independent parts of the artwork, to take control of their experience of
                the piece. </p>
