            <h3>Data Management</h3>
            <p><img src="images/tech_1.jpg" alt="Iphone but with organs" height="250" />I will be
                conducting data mining, i.e. using a computer to identify patterns and relationships
                within data sets, on the Hathitrust database wherein I will focus LGBTQ+ studies,
                family studies, and women’s studies. I will cluster documents into subtopics and
                mine and collage them separately; for example I may have an Surreal glass ceiling
                panel, a Dadaist motherhood panel, and a Postmodern transgender rights panel.</p>
            <h3>Web Development and Interactivity </h3>
            <p>All of the art styles that I am encompassing in this project feature an element of
                subjectivity; the viewer alters the artwork. To keep with that motif, the collage
                will be available online in a clickable format that allows the viewer to interact
                with the independent parts of the artwork, to take control of their experience of
                the piece. </p>
            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p>I intend to learn Python in order to conduct text modelling. I will do this using the
                Codecademy’s Python 3 introductory course, Coursera’s Applied Text Mining in Python
                program, and specific Python lessons by The Programming Historian. If I run into any
                issues, I am able to reach out to the Humanities Digital Librarian, Tyrica Terry
                Kapral.</p>
            <h3>Javascript</h3>
            <p>I intend to learn Javascript in order to make the site interactive. I will do this
                using Codecademy’s introductory and intermediate Javascript courses. If I run into
                any issues, I am able to reach out to my mentor who has abundant Javascript
                experience.</p>
